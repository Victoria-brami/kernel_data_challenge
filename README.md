# kernel_data_challenge

Support vector machines are powerful tools to achieve image classification tasks. This code implements a multi-classes' SVC model built to classify samples into p=10 classes. To obtain the results with the default hyper-parametes, one can launch "python start.py". To specify some hyper-parameters, one should use the predict.py file in src/ folder.
